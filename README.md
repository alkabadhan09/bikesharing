## Overview

### Backgroound

In this module, we act as a Data Analyst and perform analysis and created visualization on bikesharing business of New York City in order to open a similar business in the hometown of Des Moine. We used Tableau to create visualizations for number of trips, peak hours for business, top starting and ending locations for bike rentals, number of rides by gendr etc. We also learned how to make dashboards and stories using Tableau Public.

### Purpose

The purpose of the challenge is to create more visualization on the same data for a better pitch to the investors who might be interested in the Des Moines Bikesharing business. We created visualization to show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders,
show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and to show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. We also created a story at the end and uploaded it to out Tableau Public account.

## Results

From this, we can tell that most bikes get checked out within the first 40 minutes of opening time.

This visualization indicates that most bike riders are men.

This visualization reiterates that men are in the majority when it comes to renting the bikes.

Trips by Weekday per Hour indicates that most frequent rental start times are between 6AM-9AM and the most frequest checkout times are 4PM-7PM.

This visualization indicated that most business comes from yearly male subscribers.

Top Starting Locations map shows that a lot of the bike riders' starting point is Manhattan.

Like the top starting location, Manhattan is the top ending location as well.

## Summary

Overall, these visualizations convey the data well for what is needed to start a bikesharing business but NYC is a large city where not a lot of people have cars and they majorly rely on public transportation. A visualization of the vehicle owners of both NYC and Des Moines would be helpful. Population of NYC is 8.804 million whereas population of Des Moines is 214,133 which is a huge difference. A visualization would be good on how much of the NYC population is actually using the bikesharing to get an idea of how the business would do in Des Moines compared to NYC.

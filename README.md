## Overview

### Backgroound

In this module, we act as a Data Analyst and perform analysis and created visualization on bikesharing business of New York City in order to open a similar business in the hometown of Des Moine. We used Tableau to create visualizations for number of trips, peak hours for business, top starting and ending locations for bike rentals, number of rides by gendr etc. We also learned how to make dashboards and stories using Tableau Public.

### Purpose

The purpose of the challenge is to create more visualization on the same data for a better pitch to the investors who might be interested in the Des Moines Bikesharing business. We created visualization to show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders,
show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and to show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. We also created a story at the end and uploaded it to out Tableau Public account.

From this, we can tell that most bikes get checked out within the first 40 minutes of opening time.
